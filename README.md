# RideAustin

## This is a Python analysis of RideAustin's daily ride requests, identifying a weekly cycle in requests

Ride Austin is a nonprofit, municipal ridesharing service based in Austin, Texas, with a model comparing directly to that of Uber. The data released covers rides requested from June 16 to August 31, just over 11 weeks. It shows a clear cycle weekly, typically with peak ride demand on Saturday. 

To identify and quantify this cycle, I'm adapting code from several places to develop a model which closely adheres to the data.
